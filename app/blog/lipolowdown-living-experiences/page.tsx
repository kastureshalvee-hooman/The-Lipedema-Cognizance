            <p>
              Lipedema often goes misunderstood and unnoticed. It's often very hard living in a body which is
              stigmatized and different from the regular societal standards.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some of the most important themes this research identifies was the sense of isolation accompanied with
              lipedema. Participants described feeling different.
            </p>

            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-sage-400 pl-4 italic text-slate-600 my-6">
              "You hear repeatedly that you are not the norm or that you do not fit the norm."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Women with lipedema often hear remarks reinforcing this belief adding on to their struggles. It's also
              common to face stigma from physicians as well.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite these difficulties, this research highlights the importance and need of support. Women have often
              found support discussing their struggles with those who care and empathize with them.
            </p>

            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-sage-400 pl-4 italic text-slate-600 my-6">
              "It feels good to inform my friends... I have received a diagnosis."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Online support through communities and social media platforms also helps. However, negative comments and
              interactions cause patients to feel overwhelmed.
            </p>

            <p>Another observed theme is about the progression of lipedema.</p>

            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-sage-400 pl-4 italic text-slate-600 my-6">
              "I am terrified by everything that could trigger an exacerbation,"
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              This is a common concern among those with lipedema. This hopelessness and anxiety can decrease mental
              health.
            </p>

            <p>
              These experiences of women with lipedema should remind us of the importance of understanding and empathy.
              Lipedema has both physical and mental challenges. We, as a community, should work together to create a
              more positive environment for those with lipedema. Physicians and healthcare professionals should be
              informed about the condition effectively to potentially have a systemwide impact.
            </p>
